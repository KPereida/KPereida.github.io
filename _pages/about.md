I received a Ph.D. from the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies, advised by Prof. Angela Schoellig. I am interested in enabling robots to have a reliable performance even in unknown and dynamic environments. My research interests include robotics, control and learning-enhanced controllers. 

I am currently looking for exciting job opportunities!
