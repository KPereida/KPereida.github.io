Hi! 

I received a Ph.D. from the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies ([UTIAS](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/)), advised by [Prof. Angela Schoellig](http://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/). My doctoral research focused on designing controllers to enable robots to have a reliable performance even in unknown and dynamic environments. My research interests include robotics, control and learning-enhanced controllers.
